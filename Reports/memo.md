The problem this repository is trying to solve is to predict a price for an AirBnb property that is quick and easy for the user to access. To provide this service I am trying to limit the amount of information the user would need input to provide a prediction and have the computer generate additional data and even offer some feedback to increase value based on there advertisement.

To complete a successful model I am focusing on minimizing the percent difference between my predictions and the actual cost of successfull properties. I chose this metric instead of just minimizing difference in general because since the prices of properties vary so much a 20 dollar difference would be totally different against a rental price of 75 dollars compared to a 300 dollar price.

Currently with the model pridicting an average percent difference of .27 I cannot claim that my model is ready to be deployed, but with a closer look my data is skewed pretty far to the right which shows me that most of my prices are actually predicting better than that 27 percent difference. 

I will be trying to find a correlation between these properties that my model is missing to hopefully lower the average difference. As well as completing an app that lets a user input their own data.
